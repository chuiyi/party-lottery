## Origin

This was a toy app for use in my wedding back in 2013. I could not find a suitable and good-looking lottery app so I wrote one in a couple of hours. Some friends of mine showed interest in it. Since then I added a configuration panel and several other features to make it a real app.

## Plan

Years later I found this app is still pretty useful. But the code was written in a rush and is too messy to work on.

* Rewrite JavaScript in ~~CoffeeScript or~~ ECMAScript 2015
* Rewrite CSS using Sass and Autoprefixer
* Remove jQuery & Modernizr (along with ancient browsers support)
* Package with [nw.js](https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js)
